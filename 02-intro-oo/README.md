## Ruby

# Prerequisites

- Data Types
    - Object
- Methods
    - difference between defining and invoking a method
- Variables and Scope
    - instance variable

# What We'll Learn Today

- What is an object?
- How does your program communicate with an object?
- Class vs Instance
- `new` and `initialize`
- Instance methods
- attr_ macros
- `self`

# Agenda

1. Why OO and how does it work?
    - to make our applications as close as possible to the real world 
    - `thing` => Class/Instance
        - Class is a blueprint 
        - 
    - hasketball: Player 
        - name
        - rebounds
        - shoe_size 
        - team 
    - behaviors
        - methods 

Would Team be a different object? 
    - Yes
    - The team has a relationship with the player
    - A team can have many players 
    - A player belongs to a team 

"Everything in Ruby is an object" 

We communicate using `.` syntax 




An object doesn't have to be a real world thing?
